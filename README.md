3. Visit `http://localhost:5000/`.

### Window

1. Clone and navigate to this repo.
2. `init.bat`

## Measure performance between encryption functions

`python3 yapp/performance.py` to record the performances.
`python3 yapp/show_performance.py` to show some graph.

## Measure accuracies between descryption functions

`python3 yapp/accuracy.py` to record the accuracies.
`python3 yapp/show_accuracy.py` to show more graph.

## TODOs

- Actually signed in user and show user specific content? (Mess with session cookie)
- Style the website
- Rewrite encryption functions
